# Library Management System

## Project Overview:
The `Library Management System` is a meticulously crafted system designed to facilitate seamless interactions with library resources. It encapsulates a set of classes each responsible for specific aspects of library management such as publications handling, user interface interactions, and stream manipulations. This repository serves as a demonstration of object-oriented design principles, memory management, operator overloading, and abstract class utilization.

## Core Components:

### 1. Streamable:
   - **Purpose**: Acts as an abstract base class providing an interface for interaction with IO streams.
   - **Features**:
     - Pure Virtual Functions for writing to an output stream and reading from an input stream.
     - Capability to determine if the object is in a valid state and the nature (console-based or not) of a given IO object.

### 2. Publication:
   - **Purpose**: Represents a library item and encapsulates relevant information and behaviors.
   - **Features**:
     - Contains information like title, shelf ID, membership, library reference, and publication date.
     - Provision for various functionalities including check-out mechanisms, attribute setters, and title comparison.

### 3. Menu & MenuItem:
   - **Purpose**: Provide mechanisms to create interactive console menus allowing user navigation.
   - **Features**:
     - Ability to add menu items, display menus, and capture user selections.
     - Encompasses the functionality to validate the content and dynamically allocate memory for menu items.

### 4. PublicationSelector:
   - **Purpose**: Serves as a user interface component to facilitate selection amongst available publications.
   - **Features**:
     - Supports paginated displays, efficient sorting mechanisms, and the ability to reset selections.
     - The capacity to add publications to the menu by address or reference.

## Detailed Features:
- **Robust Memory Management**: Ensures that dynamically allocated memory is handled meticulously to avoid memory leaks, while ensuring optimal performance.
- **Type Safety & Intuitive Interaction**: Extensive use of operator overloading allows for intuitive interactions with objects and enhanced type safety.
- **Extensibility & Modularity**: Abstract classes like `Streamable` ensure that the system is extensible and modifications can be made with minimal impact on existing functionalities.
- **Usability**: Features like pagination in `PublicationSelector` class ensure that users can easily navigate through large sets of publications.

## Possible Future Enhancements:
- **Advanced Logging**: Implementation of a more robust logging and auditing system to track interactions with the library resources.
- **Database Integration**: Plans to integrate with external database systems to handle extensive library collections efficiently.
- **Advanced Search & Filters**: Development of sophisticated search algorithms and filters for efficient resource location and access.
